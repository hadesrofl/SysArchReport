#### Motivation (1)
* Market globalization leads to higher demands of customers in terms of quality, cost and product customization
* Industrial competitiveness also means shorter product lifecycles, increased product variety and shorter time-to-market

+++
#### Motivation (2)
* Companies need to face these changes with new manufacturing paradigms and business models
* For production digitization and complete process integration, there is a need for concepts, techniques and technologies that will support it

+++
#### Digitalization leads to...
* Resources becoming pluggable and smarter (communicating, cooperating, collaborating)
* the usage of the Cyber-Physical-Systems (CPS) paradigm
* the need for a system to handle these heterogenous CPS

+++
#### Emerging Problems
* Manufacturers systems consist of:
 * Mostly centralized legacy systems and control mechanisms
 * Heterogenous components

+++
#### Approach for the Future
* Distributed and agile systems
* System components functionality decoupled as services
<p>=> service-based architectures like the Service-oriented Architecture (SoA)</p>
* Seamless vertical and horizontal system integration

+++
#### State of the Art Methodologies
* Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)
* Plug and Produce Technology
* Service-oriented Architecture
* Cloud Technology
