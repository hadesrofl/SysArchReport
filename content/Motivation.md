#### Motivation
* Market globalization leads to higher demands of customers in terms of quality, cost and product customization
* Companies need to face these changes with new manufacturing paradigms and business models
* For production digitalization and complete process integration there is a need for concepts, techniques and technologies to support it

+++
#### Digitalization leads to...
* Resources becoming pluggable and smarter (communicating, cooperating, collaborating)
* the usage of the Cyber-Physical-Systems (CPS) paradigm
* the need for a system to handle these heterogenous CPS

+++
#### Emerging Problems
* Currently:
 * Mostly centralized legacy systems and control mechanisms
 * Heterogenous components
* Approach for the future:
 * Distributed and agile systems
 * System components functionality decoupled as services => service-based architectures like the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)
 * Seamless vertical and horizontal system integration
