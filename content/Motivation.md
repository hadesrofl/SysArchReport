#### Motivation
* Market globalization leads to higher demands of customers in terms of quality, cost and product customization
* Companies need to face these changes with new manufacturing paradigms and business models
* For production digitalization and complete process integration there is a need for concepts, techniques and technologies to support it

+++
#### Digitalization leads to...
* Resources becoming pluggable and smarter (communicating, cooperating, collaborating)
* the usage of the Cyber-Physical-Systems (CPS) paradigm
* the need for a system to handle these heterogenous CPS

+++
#### Emerging Problems
* Currently:
 * Mostly centralized legacy systems and control mechanisms
 * Heterogenous components

<li>Approach for the future:</li>
<ul>
<li>Distributed and agile systems</li>
<li>System components functionality decoupled as services => service-based architectures like the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)</li>
<li>Seamless vertical and horizontal system integration</li>
</ul>
</ul>
