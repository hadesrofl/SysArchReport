#### PERFoRM Architecture - Middleware
* Gateway between back-bone and machinery levels
* Service registration and discovery
* data transformation
* routing of message exchange
* prioritization of messages delivery
* and some more

+++
#### PERFoRM Architecture - Standard Interface
* allows to interconnect heterogenous HW devices and SW applications
* enhances seamless interoperability and plugability
* describes a contract implementation of each service (i.e. name, input and output parameters)
* definition of the data model

+++
#### PERFoRM Architecture - Technology Adapter
* exposes legacy systems' data and functionalities according to the PERFoRM standard interfaces
* converts information about the data format of the legacy systems to the PERFoRM data model
* dependant on the technology for the middleware
* heavily involves the HW and SW development
