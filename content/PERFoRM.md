#### What is PERFoRM (1)
<blockquote><font size="5">The EU HORIZON 2020 project PERFoRM (Production harmonizEd Reconfiguration of Flexible Robots and Machinery) is aiming at the <strong>conceptual transformation</strong> of <em>existing</em> production systems towards <strong>agile</strong>, <strong>networked plug-and-produce production systems</strong> in order to achieve a <em>flexible manufacturing environment</em> based on <strong>fast reconfiguration</strong> of machinery and robots as response to operational or business events.</font></blockquote>

#### What is PERFoRM? (2)
* Architecture (currently researched and specified) to support the production digitalization by providing:
 * service-orientation to expose system functionalities as services
 * a middleware as a common platform for information exchange

+++
#### What is PERFoRM (3)
* Further support by providing:
 * a common language for standard interfaces
 * technology adapters to integrate legacy systems
 * a Human-Machine-Interface (HMI) to allow the human to interact with the system and drive its flexibility
