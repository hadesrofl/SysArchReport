### Specification of the PERFoRM Architecture for the Seamless Production System Reconfiguration

+++
#### What is PERFoRM? (1)
* Project of the EU Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme
* Architecture (currently researched and specified) to support the production digitalization by providing:
 * a distributed control system for smart components (CPS)
 * seamless system Reconfiguration
 * ways to allow integrated planning and simulation

+++
#### What is PERFoRM? (2)
* ... support the production digitalization by providing:
 * service-orientation to expose system functionalities as services
 * a middleware as a common platform for information exchange
 * a common language for standard interfaces
 * technology adapters to integrate legacy systems
 * a proper Human-Machine-Interface (HMI) to allow the human to interact with the system and drive its flexibility
