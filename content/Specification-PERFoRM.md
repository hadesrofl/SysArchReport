### Specification of the PERFoRM Architecture for the Seamless Production System Reconfiguration

+++
# Motivation
* Market globalization leads to higher demands of customers in terms of quality, cost and product customization
* Companies need to face these changes with new manufacturing paradigms and business models
* For production digitalization and complete process integration there is a need for concepts, techniques and technologies to support it

+++
# Digitalization leads to...
* Resources becoming pluggable and smarter (communicating, cooperating, collaborating)
* the usage of the Cyber-Physical-Systems (CPS) paradigm
* the need for a system to handle these heterogenous CPS

+++
# Emerging Problems
* Currently:
 * Mostly centralized legacy systems and control mechanisms
 * Heterogenous components
* Approach for the future:
 * Distributed and agile systems
 * System components functionality decoupled as services => service-based architectures like the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)
 * Seamless vertical and horizontal system integration

+++
# PERFoRM
* Project of the EU Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme
* Architecture (currently researched and developed) to support the production digitalization by providing:
 * a distributed control system for smart components (CPS)
 * seamless system Reconfiguration
 * ways to allow integrated planning and simulation
 * service-orientation to expose system functionalities as services
 * a middleware as a common platform for information exchange
 * a common language for standard interfaces
 * technology adapters to integrate legacy systems
 * a proper Human-Machine-Interface (HMI) to allow the human to interact with the system and drive its flexibility
