#### What is PRIME (1)
* Result of the EU funded FP7 PRIME project
* Architecture using a hybrid structure integrating a MAS with traditional automation equipment
* MAS handles reconfiguration of the productions control system
  => Agent technology might lead to time processing issues, communication and process control
* Productions control system and MAS operate independently
  => lessens burdens of MAS and increase flexibility of the overall system
