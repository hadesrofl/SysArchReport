### PRIME

+++
#### What is PRIME (1)
* Result of the EU funded FP7 PRIME project (2007 - 2013)
* Architecture using a hybrid structure integrating a MAS with traditional automation equipment

+++
#### What is PRIME (2)
* MAS handles reconfiguration of the productions control system
<p>=> Agent technology might lead to time processing issues of communication and process control</p>
* Productions control system and MAS operate independently
<p>=> lessens burdens of MAS and increase flexibility of the overall system</p>
